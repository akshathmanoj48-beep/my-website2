      <p>
        My name is Akshath. I am a student and I live in India. I study in class
        9A and I am 14 years old. I go to school every day and enjoy learning
        new things. My favorite subject is Science because I like doing
        experiments and discovering how things work. My teachers are very kind
        and helpful, and I have many good friends at school. We play and study
        together and always help each other. In my free time, I like to draw
        pictures,watch TV,LAP,spot trains and know more about them,and
        experiment with arduino I also enjoy spending time with my family.I
        always try to be honest, respectful, and helpful to everyone. My aim in
        life is to become a good and successful person. I believe that with hard
        work and determination, I can achieve anything I dream of.
